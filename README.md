# Resolver

### Purpose
Mapping between information models is a complicated and laborious function. In case of very different information structures, it might even fail. Also creating an interface between the Telefonica information model inside x:akta and the MW SDN controller has been cancelled during the Transport SDN Pilot project. (An interface between the Enghouse information model inside x:akta and the MW SDN controller has been created instead, but later discontinued.) The Resolver represents a workaround, which allows to address single attributes in the MW SDN controller from within x:akta or other legacy tools in a very generic way. The consuming tool must formulate the path to the targeted attribute according to the ONF information structure but is free to substitute segments of the path by placeholders. The Resolver parses through the paths, identifies the placeholders and replaces them by concrete address components. The Resolver does the bare and generic parsing. It depends on further applications to provide the information for replacing the placeholders.
